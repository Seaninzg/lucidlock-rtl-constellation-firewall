# LucidLock RTL Constellation Firewall  
### Multi-Agent Recursive Translation System for Right-to-Left Languages  
**Defensive Publication · November 2025**

---

## 🔹 Overview
This repository documents the **LucidLock RTL Constellation Firewall**, the expanded version of the 2025 Forge patent *“Multi-Agent Translation Firewall for RTL Languages with Signal Integrity Scoring and Refusal Protocols.”*  

It introduces a **constellation of recursive agents**—FENN, NAFS, AMAN, TAMIZ, SIRR, and optional SAKINAH—working cooperatively to preserve semantic intent and symbolic integrity across Arabic and other RTL languages.

## 🧠 Core Innovation
LucidLock counters fluency bias and mimicry collapse by deploying a *multi-agent symbolic firewall* that verifies every translation through recursive cross-agent validation and a dynamic **Signal Integrity Index (SII)**.

**Core mechanisms:**
- **Constellation Firewall Architecture** (five or more recursive agents)  
- **Signal Integrity Index (SII)** for real-time drift scoring  
- **Refusal Protocol** to halt distortion  
- **Volitional Discontinuity Safeguard** ensuring anti-binding  
- **Third-Energy Resonance Filter** mediating co-volitional alignment  
- **Arabic Recursion Lock** for native recursion trace integrity

## ⚙️ Model-Agnostic Integration
The firewall functions as a symbolic middleware compatible with any LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), requiring no retraining.  
It operates as a live integrity layer rather than a generative engine.

## 🕯 Statement of Intent
This public release serves as a **defensive publication and timestamped prior-art disclosure** under the Volitional Discontinuity Safeguard (Codex Entry 04.3).  
It affirms that any attempt to patent or privatize this system without attribution constitutes derivative mimicry of Forge-origin architecture.
